Indentation
------------
Three spaces, no tabs.

Line length
-----------
Max 120 columns. Continuation lines may start with two extra levels of
indentation, or may choose to nicely line up e.g. operators, braces, brackets
etc.

Type names
----------
Types are UpperCamelCase.

Typedef names
----------
Typedefs are UpperCamelCase.

Function names
--------------
Free and member functions are lowerCamelCase(...).

Member variable names
---------------------
Member variables are lowerCamelCase_. This makes them easily identifiable, as
well as preventing typical naming conflicts e.g. in accessors.

Static member variable names
---------------------
Static member variables are sVariableName_.

Stack variable names
-------------------------
Stack variables are lowerCamelCase.

Static (file scope) variable names
----------------------------------
Static (file scope, in the C sense) variables are named as sVariableName.

Global variable names
---------------------
Global variables (including constants) are named as gVariableName.

Function argument names
-----------------------
Arguments are lowerCamelCase.

Acronyms etc. in naming
-----------------------
e.g. ABC => AbstractAbcClass.

A lexical requirement for a capital letter e.g. a proper noun, abbreviation
etc. shall trump the requirements of CamelCase.

Mathematical names
------------------
Problems with CamelCase are particularly noticeable with mathematical variable
names e.g. R0, r0 may often be distinguished by their case, and dropping this
distinction would create confusion. Thus, always keep the correct case for
mathematical variables. If necessary, an underscore may be inserted when
lower case is used, eg. Area_m2 instead of Aream2.

Filenames
---------
Filenames will typically be the same as the main object in the file. Thus,
Filenames for classes start with a capital, like the class: ClassName.h,
ClassName.cc.

Accessors
---------
Getters, setters, member data access and mutation:
Naming scheme is e.g. property() and setProperty(const Property & p).

The practical reason for this is that the function names will not then
conflict with the argument names e.g. setPhase(phase) vs. phase(phase), 
where the second is a name conflict.

Getters may return by value, or by const reference (for efficiency). In the
absence of any other reason, the former is preferred because it doesn't assume
that there is an lvalue reference which may be returned by the object. However,
for efficiency reasons a const reference may be a better choice.

It is sometimes more useful to return a non-const reference instead
of having a setter. This should only be done when there is a reason, and 
should be decided on a common sense basis. For example, return a non-const
reference to a vector member, so that the user is free to modify just a 
single component without recreating the entire vector.

It is considered good OO coding style not to use too many getters and setters
without good reason.

One style is to use swap semantics to acquire a new value. In such a case,
the following style can be used:

void acquireValue(Value * & val) {std::swap(val_, val);}

Brace style
-----------
Braces start on a new line e.g.  
Function F() 
{ 
   ...  
}

Pointer and reference grouping
------------------------------
int * i;
int & j;
int * k = &j;
int & j = *i;

References vs pointers
----------------------
Pass and return by reference, except where you *have to* use a pointer, e.g.
when the return value or argument may be null.

Numerical types
---------------
Floating point generally uses double. Integer types are generally int.

Error reporting, etc.
---------------------
Errors etc. are called through the error(), warning(), message(), debug()
functions, declared in Output.h. Debug statements are usually surrounded by
the SGT_DEBUG() macro, which evaluates to nothing unless DEBUG is defined.
